<p><span class="smcap">About</span> eight o’clock of a June morning the train
draws up at a small station within a short run
south of the Scottish metropolis. It is not a
typical June morning. There has been a fortnight’s
drought, followed by two days of rain—the
latter rejoicing the heart of the agriculturist
and the angler; but yesternight the rain ceased,
and its place has been taken by a gray mist, or
<i>haar</i>, which the east wind is bringing up from
the German Ocean. No angler loves mist. Is it
not set down in the angler’s book of common-law
precedents, that in the case of Man <i>versus</i>
Trout, this obscure element is to be construed
in favour of the defender? The station at
which we alight is situated in an upland valley,
shut in on the north and west by the mounded
Pentlands; but this morning their outline shows
only like a denser and darker bank of clouds
in a gray waste of cloudland. Down into the
valley also, thin streaks of mist are creeping
dismally and slow, groping their way forward
with long dripping fingers, like a belated band
of midnight ghosts which the morning light has
struck with sudden blindness. To the south-west,
the Peeblesshire hills are less obscured, but
there is floating over them the dull glaze, the
leaden hue, which makes my companion sadly
prognosticate thunder—and thunder to the angler’s
sport is as fatal as mist.</p>

<p>It is indeed very far from being a typical June
morning. The earth is gray, and the sky is gray;
and the trees and hedgerows that flank the fields
and overshadow the cottages and the little inn,
are not musical with the song of any bird. There
is even in the air a touch of the east wind, that
fiend of the North Sea who comes to us annually
with the crocus and the primrose, and spends at
least three months of his baneful existence in
tying innumerable knots upon human nerves.
His sublime excellency the Sun is doubtless up,
as his custom is, long ere now, but this morning
he wilfully persists in keeping his chamber.
All this is marked in the time we take to alight
at the railway station, give up our tickets, and,
shouldering basket and rod, set out towards our
destination for the day, which lies over this long
ridge to the right.</p>

<p>Everything is very still—with the soft stillness
of a misty summer morning. Except for the
noise of the train we have just left, as it goes
coughing hysterically out of the station, one might
almost hear the grass growing. The recent rain
has washed the dust from leaf and flower, and
the fields of young grain are in the reawakened
freshness of early growth. The pastures have
drunk in the moisture; and the cows that stop
feeding for a moment to gaze on us with large
soft eyes as we pass, return with fresh zest to
their juicy morning meal. The watchdog at the
farm salutes us, as is his wont, with a little
gruff language; not meaning any great harm
perhaps, but only in the way of duty. ‘You
are not beggars,’ he seems to say, ‘and don’t
want any strong measures to be taken with you.
But you are strangers, and I dislike strangers.
Don’t stand and look at me so, for that only
irritates me. Good-morning, and be off with
you!’ In a few minutes we reach the top of
the ridge, and see the long line of the Moorfoot
Hills girdling the south and east. They are much
clearer than the Pentlands behind us, and we
have hopes that a southerly breeze may spring
up; for along the south-eastern horizon, between
the hills and the low mist-cloud above, there is
a clear line of light—the <i>weather-gleam</i>, as the
Border shepherds poetically name it—showing
where the wind is breaking through the haze
and uncurtaining the hills.</p>

<p>Our road for three or four miles lies straight
before us; for the most part, through a bleak
barren moorland. The ditches at the sides, which
serve to drain off the stagnating black bog-water,
have an abundance of bright green mosses
and water-plants on their shelving sides and
marshy bottom. There is a broad waste of peat-moss
all round, cracked and broken with black
fissures, the higher patches covered with bent-grass,
hard and wiry, brown and dry, and only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">{434}</span>
here and there showing thin blades of green.
One wonders what those straggling ewes find to
eat amid the general barrenness, and how they
manage to maintain themselves and their merry
lambs, tiny, black-faced, and black-footed, that
frolic around them. Yet this wild waste bears
promise of beauty ere the winter is on us; for
the upper margins of the ditches and the tops
of the knolls are crested with thick bunches of
heather, which, though scarcely noticeable now,
will one day shake out fragrant bells in the
autumn wind, and flush the moorland with a
purple glory. Far away to the left we hear the
jangling call of a bird—‘liddle-liddle-liddle’—rapid,
bell-like, long-continued. It is a familiar
sound during the summer months to the
wanderer among the hills, arousing, as it does,
all the other birds far and near as if with an
alarum-bell. The call is that of the sandpiper—in
some places known, from its cry, as
the ‘little fiddler,’ in others as the ‘killieleepie.’
It is one of our migratory birds, reaching us
from the south in the month of April, and
starting on its travels again, with its young
family, in the autumn. Among the other bird-calls
which its wild, startling cry has awakened,
is a plaintive ‘tee-oo, tee-oo,’ sounding eerily
over the heath. It is the voice of the graceful
redshank, which has left the seashore, as it does
every spring, and come up with its mate to
the moors to spend their honeymoon and rear
their young brood; and by-and-by it will lead
back to the sandy shore a little following of red-legs,
who will learn to pick crustaceans from the
shallow pools, and prepare for a journey to the
hills on their own account next spring. On
before us, in a clump of firs on a distant height,
we hear the deep note of the cuckoo, booming
out with its regular cadences, calling to mind
the oldest lyric in the English tongue:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Summer is i-cumin in,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Loud sing, cuckoo!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Groweth seed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bloweth mead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And springeth the wood noo.</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Sing, cuckoo!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All this is very well, but it is not the business
of the day. These are but the accidents, or
rather the pleasant incidents, of the journey; and
as we reach once more an oasis of cultivation,
we know that the water for which we are bound
lies close at hand. The day is gradually losing
its misty moodiness, is indeed slowly brightening
up. There is now a light but decided breeze
from the direction in which we lately saw the
weather-gleam appear, and when we come in
sight of the lake we find its surface shaken with
a thousand laughing ripples. The sun has not
yet looked out, but we can see, from the transparent
whiteness of the clouds at a certain spot,
that his majesty may soon be expected to show
himself. The mist has quite lifted, and save
that the higher peaks of the Moorfoots are each
capped with a misty cloud, there is little trace
here of the haze which still hangs thick on the
northern hills behind us.</p>

<p>At the water’s edge, our interest in the scenery
becomes of secondary moment. We are intent
on other things. We look anxiously across the
surface of the brightly rippling water, but not
a trout rises to the surface, and not a plash
is heard or a ring seen to tell that the finny
tribe are there. Knowing, from mournful experience,
what it is to be left at the edge of a
loch when a dead calm settles down upon it, and
your flies are no longer of use, we have brought
some worm-bait with us; and so, in order to lose
no time while the preliminary work of making
up ‘casts’ and donning waders is going on, we
put on a Stewart tackle baited with a nice
red-bodied, black-headed worm, which we plant in
that part of the water where worm has already
been known to us to kill. As we make preparations
for the further work of the day, we cast
quick glances from time to time towards the
uplifted end of our rods where they rest over
the water; but, alas, they moved not nor
‘bobbed.’ Worm was evidently not in demand
with the Fario family as a breakfast commodity.
At length, a sudden plash; and there, about
fifty yards out from the shore, we see a fine
trout just dropping back into the water. The
‘feed’ has begun! The sun had indeed been out
for a short time, and this was a signal for the
night-chilled insects to come out also, and these
in their turn, dropping upon the surface of the
water, signified to Master Fario that breakfast was
on the table, and he presently piped all hands
to the repast. In a few minutes more the lake
was dimpled and ringed with the plash of the
feeding trout.</p>

<p>There is no time to lose now. The Stewart
tackle is discarded, a cast of flies is presently
made fast to our line, and we are ready to
begin. My friend goes a little further afield—if
this term may be used in water parlance;
and I am left to do what I can on
my own account. Stepping into the water, and
moving gradually forward till I get deep enough,
I cast carefully from side to side, in hope of
attracting the attention of some one of the trout
that are rising everywhere before me. Five
minutes pass, ten minutes pass, but without
success, and I am beginning to doubt if my
selection of flies is good. By-and-by I see a
trout rise out there in the place where my
flies should be; and the quick touch along
the line, as if something had suddenly grazed
it, tells me that a trout has rushed at the
lure, and missed. There is hope in this, and
I go on with fresh vigour. A few casts made
over the same spot with as much adroitness
as is possible to a clumsy fly-fisher, brings
its reward. There is a sudden tightening of
the line, and at the same moment, a dozen yards
ahead, a big yellow trout springs curved like
a bow from the water, and falls back again with
a heavy flop. He is on! An aged countryman
on the point of the bay opposite, waiting to
see if perchance his worm-baited rod will bob,
has witnessed the plunge of my captive, and is
all intent on the issue. ‘Gie him time!’ he
shouts across the water. ‘Canny wi’ him for a
bit, and play him weel. Dinna hurry, dinna
hurry.’ The advice is not unneeded, for I am
nearly fifty yards from the shore, and there is
moreover midway a bank of sand only slightly
covered with water, through which the green
rushes are springing up. How will I get him
over that reef? I wind up slowly, while the
captive makes vigorous attempts to free himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">{435}</span>
from the deadly hook—now springing out of the
water, now curling and twisting serpent-like along
the surface, then plunging for a moment into
the deep black water, his yellow side gleaming
like a sword-blade as he shoots below. It is
the supreme moment. In a little his efforts
slacken, and he comes oftener to the surface.
I make slowly for the shore, still winding in. I
am over the sandy reef with its dangerous reeds,
which I fear may strip him from the hook. At
last I have him safely through them, and he
allows himself to be drawn quietly over the
remaining shallow to the shore, and there he
now lies—on dry land—a speckled beauty of
three-quarters of a pound, his spotted sides
gleaming like gold in the sunshine.</p>

<p>With cast put once again in order, I am into
the water for a second trial. This time I avoid
the sandy reef with its reeds, and keep clear
water between me and the shore. The lake is
deep here, and I cast slowly, letting the flies sink
a little, that the deep-feeding trout may have a
chance to see and seize them. I have succeeded
in raising one or two, but they do not seem to
be in earnest; and am in the act of withdrawing
my line preparatory to casting again, when
I find that a trout has taken it. But his tactics
are not the same as those of the former one.
He does not leap out of the water, and I only
know by the strain on the line and the curve
of the rod that he is on. This is only for a
moment, however; for I have caught a brief
glimpse of him as he dives down into the deep
water, making straight for his old lurking-place
under a steep bank a few yards in front
of me. As he thus rushes towards me, the line
slackens, the rod straightens itself, and I reel up
hastily, fearing that he is off. But no; he is only
sulking; for as the line shortens, the tension is
resumed, and presently he is obliged to rise
once more to the surface; and there he is now,
gyrating and whirling in coils of glittering
beauty. He is not so vigorous as his predecessor,
and in a little his strength is exhausted,
and he moves quietly to the shore alongside of
me, not above a yard from my foot. He is as
large as the first trout, but not in quite such
fine condition, being flatter about the shoulders,
and having a slight suspicion of lankiness in
the sides. Another fortnight of fly-diet and he
might have scaled a pound.</p>

<p>I fish on for another hour or two, with always
some occasional success, and have, angler-like,
begun to estimate the weight of my basket at the
day’s end—counting, of course, my trout before
they are caught—when, alack and well-a-day! I
begin to be cognisant of the sad fact that the
breeze is gradually dying down, and that the
glorious ripple on the water is gliding away into
a soft glittery waviness, not more pronounced than
the zigzags on watered silk. In a short time
the breeze has actually died off, and the water
of the little bay in which I stand lies smooth
and clear before me like a sheet of polished
steel. Alas, what can angler do in such a strait?
You may deceive the trout with your artificial
flies when the breeze is blowing and the ripple
is strong; but the advantage is all on the
side of the finny ones when the wind falls and
the ripple ceases. You may cast your flies
with as gentle a hand as may be; but his
quick eye sees something more than your flies,
and he knows from experience that a respectably
born and bred insect, fresh from its pupa-case,
does not come out for a sail on the water with
a yard or two of shining gut trailing behind
it, or go about leading three or four other of its
fellows after it in a string. No, no; trout have
learned a thing or two under the operation of
the law of heredity, just as we, his human—or,
if you will, inhuman—captors have done.
We may therefore reel up and take to dry land,
till it pleases Eolus again to send us a prospering
breeze.</p>

<p>As we sit on the soft grass and eat our lunch,
we can note the aspect of things around us.
The sun is shining steadily down with all his
summer brightness and fervour, and the still air
feels sultry and close. As you look along the
surface of the calm water, you can see the
heated air radiating from it like a shimmer of
colourless flame. The white farmhouse on the
opposite side basks serenely at the foot of the
hills that overhang it; and a warm dusky haze
floats over the neighbouring ravine, where an
ancient stream has cut its way down through the
lofty range. Not a sound breaks the stillness
of the air, not a wavelet disturbs the glassy
line of the beach. By-and-by there arises a low
buzzing sound, gradually increasing in intensity,
till you almost think it must be some far-away
railway engine blowing off steam. You look up,
and there, on either side of you, a yard deep as
far as you can see, is a colony of innumerable
midges disporting themselves in the hot air.
There must be millions of those tiny creatures,
the combined action of whose little wings can
send such a hissing through the stillness. Shoals
of them whisk round your head, poking into
your eyes and ears, and tickling your face and
hands. A whiff or two of tobacco-smoke comes
in as a handy expedient to drive off the insignificant
troublers; and the pipe, besides, is wonderfully
soothing as you rest your tired shoulders
on the grass. But, hark! what is that long
low rumble coming up to us from the far south-west—over
there where Dundreich raises his
brown summit in the hot haze, with a leaden-coloured
sky in the distance behind him? My
trusty comrade was right in his morning prognostication:
we are in for thunder.</p>

<p>There is in reality no wind; but, as frequently
happens in mountainous districts even in still
days, occasional cold currents of air gravitate
from the hills to lower levels; and yonder is
one playing over the surface of the lake now,
just round the corner of this land-locked bay.
We cannot afford to miss even this temporary
ripple; for if the thunder comes near there
will be an end to sport for a few hours to
come. As I step along through the patches
of rushy grass that grow by the margin of
the lake, I see a small bird glide quickly out
of one of those patches and disappear with
suspicious celerity and quietness behind another
a few yards off. I have not lost in middle manhood
the bird-nesting instincts of boyhood’s years,
and I am certain, from that bird’s quick, low,
quiet mode of flight, that it has just risen from
its nest. A few minutes’ search confirms this;
for there, beneath a patch of long grass, is the
little cavity, lined cosily with dry grass and hairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">{436}</span>
and five small oval dusky eggs, mottled with
reddish-brown dots and blotches. It is the nest
of the yellowhammer. I lift one of the eggs,
which feels smooth and warm, and think for a
minute how best I might carry it home with me
to little town-bred bairns that scarce ever saw a
bird’s nest. But I conclude that I cannot possibly
carry the egg home unbroken, and so return it
to its place beside the other four; where, in due
course, if boys and rats and weasels let it
alone, it will produce its gaping addition to the
family of yorlings. A little further on, I descry
a small sandpiper flitting before me along the
shore, poking with its lance-like bill into the
sand, and wading leg-deep through the shallow
creeks, occasionally flying a yard or two, just to
show me its long pointed brown wings and its
breast of snowy white. It is the dunlin, a gay,
active little fellow; and I can see that its mate
is waiting for it a short way ahead, and when
they meet, they make a dip or two to each other,
by way of familiar courtesy, and then disappear
together round the bend of the shore.</p>

<p>I have reached the point of the promontory
beyond which the water shows a temporary
ripple, and am into it in a trice. My success
is greater than I had anticipated, for I scarcely
expected a rise. At the third cast, and just as I
am drawing out slack from my line in order to
make a longer throw, my lure is seized, and a
bright bow of silver shoots up a yard above the
water. It is not a yellow trout this time, but
one of the Lochleven variety, with some thousands
of the fry of which the noble proprietor of these
fishings stocked the lake a few years ago. They
are vigorous fellows these Lochleven trout. Five
times did this one leap straight out of the water
before I had him on the shore; and even then,
he nearly escaped. He was being guided through
a shallow creek running into the lake, when I
noticed that he had succeeded in unhooking
himself. Had he not had the strength played
out of him, he would have been off into the
deeper water like a streak of light. But now
he is weak and confused, and aimlessly pokes his
nose into the bank, giving me just sufficient time
to get between him and the lake and throw him
out with my hands. He is a beautiful specimen
of half-a-pound, finely spotted, his gleaming sides
of a rich creamy whiteness, with a subdued pink
flush shining through.</p>

<p>But why prolong the story? The thunder came
nearer, though it did not break over us; and by
the time the hour arrived for us to re-cross the
moor, under the westering sun, to the little
station we had left in the morning, my companion
and myself had—not <i>big</i> baskets, as some
baskets are counted—but baskets big enough to
send us home well pleased and contented.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are two ways of going home from a
day’s fishing (we do not refer to roads or means
of travel, but to moods of mind). The one is
as we come home now; the other is when we
come home ‘clean’—that is, with nothing. In
the morning we have started with no idea but
what relates to the fish we are to catch, hope
being naturally in the ascendant. But in the
evening, if we have had a bad day’s work, we
are in a different mood, with our ideas much
enlarged beyond that of merely catching trout.
We suggest and enumerate to each other, with
extraordinary facility, the compensating advantages
of our position. We have had a day in
the open air; we have had vigorous healthy
exercise for the shoulders and arms (which are
sore enough, perhaps, in all conscience, though
we would not for our lives admit it); we have
enjoyed the sights and sounds of nature, and
have something like a triumphant feeling of
superiority over our poor town companions who
have been all the day in chamber or workshop,
with nothing better to inflate their lungs than
the smoky city atmosphere, and nothing more to
delight their ears than the monotonous jingle of
tramcar bells and the rattling of cabs over the
stony street. Our compensating advantages are
immense! Sorry we have not caught more
trout? Pooh, nonsense! What have trout to do
with it, except as an inducement to go out for a
day to moor and river? Do you take us for fishmongers?</p>

<p>And so, self-consoled, and weary enough,
we regain the city with its flaring lamps
and crowded streets, and go home to tell our
experiences, and dream of alder-shaded banks and
silver streams, and the landing of bigger trout
than are ever likely to charm us in our waking
hours.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVII.—DOWN BY THE RIVER.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were silent until they reached the stile at
the foot of the Willowmere meadows, where they
were to part.</p>

<p>The information which Mrs Joy had given
them was a source of special anxiety to Madge,
apart from her considerations on Pansy’s account.
If Caleb had really determined to leave the
country at once, Philip would lose his most able
assistant in carrying out the work, which was
already presenting so many unforeseen and
unprovided-for difficulties, that it was severely
taxing the strength of body and mind. Besides,
the few men who still maintained a half-hearted
allegiance would take alarm when they found
that even Caleb the foreman had deserted, and
abandon their leader altogether. Madge was
afraid to think of what effect this might have
on Philip. Although he had striven hard to
hide it from her, she had detected in his manner
undercurrents of excitement, impatience, and irritability
under which he might at any moment
break down. His mind was much troubled; and
the knowledge that it was so had been the main
inspiration of her earnest appeal to Mr Beecham
to help him.</p>

<p>She sympathised with Caleb, and understood
the bitterness of his disappointment by the resolution
he had so hastily adopted. He was casting
aside what promised to be an opportunity to
rise in the world in the manner in which he
would most desire to rise—with his fellow-workers;
and abandoning a friend who needed
his help and who, he was aware, held him in
much respect. On Pansy’s account she was
grieved, but not angry; for although she had
been misled by her conduct towards Caleb, as
he had been, she would not have the girl act
otherwise than she was doing, if she really felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">{437}</span>
that she could not give the man her whole thought
and heart, as a wife should do. But there was
the question—Did she understand herself? The
sulky insistence that she would not have him
seemed to say ‘yes;’ but the pale face and
quivering lips when she heard that he was about
to emigrate seemed to say ‘no.’ A few days’
reflection would enable her to decide, and in
the meanwhile some effort must be made to induce
Caleb to postpone his departure.</p>

<p>‘You will think about all this, Pansy,’ she said
when they halted by the stile; ‘and to-morrow,
or next day, perhaps, or some time soon, you
will tell me how you have come to change your
mind about him.’</p>

<p>‘It is better he should go,’ answered the girl
without looking at Madge.</p>

<p>Pansy did not take the shortest way home.
She passed between the dancing beeches—their
bare branches had no claim to that festive designation,
unless it might be a dance of hags—and
under the blackened willows which cast a shadow
over the little footpath by the river-side. Lances
of light crossed the path, and seemed to be darting
out towards the silver shields which the sun
made on the running water. The lances of light
dazzled her eyes, and the shadows seemed to
press down on her head; whilst the sharp tinkle
made by the rippling water in the clear atmosphere
sounded discordantly in her ears. She
saw no beauty anywhere and heard no pleasant
sounds.</p>

<p>She was walking against the stream: thinking
about nothing: stupid and unhappy: figures
seemed to flit before her without conveying any
meaning to her senses. She neither knew nor
asked herself why she had chosen this way by the
stream, instead of taking the straight road home
through the forest. Some instinct had suggested
that by taking this way she was less likely to meet
any one.</p>

<p>Walking quickly, the keen wind made her cheeks
tingle and seemed gradually to clear the fog out
of her head. She had heard girls, and women too,
boast about the number of men who had ‘asked’
them, and she knew that some of them had even
multiplied the number for their own exaltation.
They all considered it a thing to be proud of, and
the more disappointments they had caused, the
merrier they were. Why, then, should she take
on so because she had been obliged to say ‘no’ to
one man? She ought rather to be sorry that it
was only one. Of course there was something in
Caleb different from the other lads who had come
about her, and who would have been ready enough
to put the great question if she had shown any
willingness to listen to it. She had not done so,
and they had caused her no bother. But then she
could not deny to herself that she had given Caleb
reason to think that she was willing; and she liked
him—liked him very much. That was why she
was distressed, as she had told Madge.</p>

<p>And what was the phantom in her brain which
had rendered it necessary to cause so much worry
to Caleb and herself?... She would not admit
that there was any phantom. She was quite sure
of it (and there was an unconscious toss of the head
at this point); and her refusal meant no more
than that she did not care enough for him. Surely
that was reason enough for saying ‘no’ without
seeking for any other. And yet this satisfactory
answer to her own question made her the more
uneasy with herself, because she was conscious that
she was shirking the whole truth.</p>

<p>She passed out from under the shadow of the
willows at a point where a broken branch of a
huge old elm had formed an archway, and a little
farther on was the ford, where a shaky wooden
foot-bridge crossed the water leading to the door
of the squat white alehouse where thirsty carriers
felt bound to halt. Unlike most other wayside
inns, its glory had not been completely destroyed
by the railways. The walls were kept white.
The old thatch-roof was neatly trimmed and carefully
patched wherever age or the elements
rendered patching requisite, so that it presented
a fine study of variegated greens and browns, with
here and there a dash of bright yellow. The
inside was clean and tidy; and in cold weather
there was always a cheerful blaze in the big fireplace.
The secret of this pleasant condition of
the <i>Ford Inn</i> was that the tenant farmed a bit of
the contiguous land, on which he depended more
than on the profits of his excellent ‘home-brewed.’</p>

<p>The road southward from the ford passed the
gates of Ringsford Manor. Going in that direction,
Coutts Hadleigh was crossing the foot-bridge
when Pansy reached the elm, and at sight of him
she halted under the broken branch. The colour
came back to her cheeks for an instant and left
them paler than before. She had often heard of
the pitfalls which beset the steps of maidens who
lift their eyes too high; but she was incapable of
nice arguments about the proper level of sight
for one in her position. He had said many pretty
things to her, always asked a flower from her,
and at the harvest-home he had danced with her
more than with any of the other girls. She was
pleased; and now she owned that she had more
than once wondered, when the Manor carriage
with the ladies passed and she was courtesying by
the wayside, how she would look if sitting in
their place.</p>

<p>But that admission under the light of this
day’s experience revealed an ugly possibility, and
taught her the alphabet of a disagreeable lesson
in life.</p>

<p>She waited until Coutts had got some distance
from the ford; then she crossed the road, and
entering a ploughed field, hurried homeward,
keeping close by the hedge, as if afraid to be
seen.</p>

<p>Her father was kneeling on the hearth lighting
the fire, his thin cheeks drawn into hollows as
he blew the wood into flame.</p>

<p>‘That you, Pansy?’ (poof). ‘What ails you
the day’ (poof), ‘that there’s neither fire nor’
(poof) ‘dinner for me when I come in frae my
work?’</p>

<p>A series of vigorous ‘poofs’ followed. Pansy,
whilst quickly relieving him of his task and
arranging the table, explained what had happened
in the washhouse, and how Miss Heathcote had
taken her to the doctor.</p>

<p>‘Oh, you were wi’ her,’ said the gardener,
paying little attention to her accident. ‘I
thought you might have been awa wi’ some other
body, for I never knew women-folk neglectin’
the dinner exceptin’ in cases o’ courtin’ or deein’.’</p>

<p>Most men would have been in a temper on
returning hungry from work and finding that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">{438}</span>
the fire had to be lighted to heat the food; but
Sam having been rarely subjected to such an
experience, and being under the impression that
he was soon to be left to look after himself
entirely, accepted the present position calmly,
as a foretaste of what was coming.</p>

<p>‘And you have had nothing yoursel’, Pansy.
Aweel, I’m no astonished. I daresay your
mother whiles wanted her dinner when she was
thinking about me.’</p>

<p>Sam, finding dinner a hopeless achievement,
began, with customary deliberation, to fill and
light his pipe. His daughter’s short answers he
attributed to the natural shyness in the presence
of her father of a maiden who was expecting soon
to become a wife.</p>

<p>‘I ken what you are thinking about, Pansy;
but I’m no going to say a word on the subject
at this time of day. There’s another matter to
speak about.’</p>

<p>What relief she felt! How gladly she put the
question:</p>

<p>‘What’s that, father?’</p>

<p>‘There’s news come of your gran’father. He
is bad wi’ the rheumatics again, and no a creature
to look after him. I’m thinking we’ll have to
make a journey over to Camberwell, and see
what can be done for him, since he’ll no come
to us here.’</p>

<p>‘I will go to him to-day,’ she ejaculated with
surprising energy; ‘and I can take that stuff the
doctor sent for you; and I can stay with him
and nurse him until he is able to get about
again.’</p>

<p>‘Hooly, hooly,’ cried Sam, taking the pipe out
of his mouth and staring at his daughter. ‘Kersey
doesna bide in the town, though he works
there.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t want to see him at all; I want to go
to grandfather,’ she answered. But it was not
entirely anxiety on account of that relative which
prompted the desire to visit Camberwell, although
her affection for the old man was strong enough
to make her eager to nurse him. She also saw
in this temporary exile the opportunity to escape
from surroundings which were threatening to
mar all her chances of happiness.</p>

<p>‘And what am I to do when ye’re awa?’</p>

<p>‘You can go up to the House for your meals,
or you can get them ready for yourself, as you
have done before. We cannot leave grandfather
alone.’</p>

<p>‘True enough, true enough, my lass; and I
suppose you’ll need to go. You’ll maybe do the
auld man some good. It would be the saving o’
him, body and sowl, if you could get him to sup
parritch and drink a wee thing less. You can
take him some flowers; but it’s a pity that you
cannot have ane of the new geraaniums for
him.’</p>

<p>So that was settled; and Pansy had never
thought there would come a day when she would
prepare eagerly to leave home.</p>

<p>When Madge heard of the mission which called
Pansy away from the cottage for a time, she felt
as well pleased as if fortune had bestowed some
good gift upon her. She saw in it something
like a providential rescue of the girl from a
dangerous position; and the readiness with which
the summons had been obeyed was a guarantee
that no great mischief had been done yet. Away
from Ringsford, with change of scenes and faces,
and with new duties of affection to perform, the
best qualities of her nature would be brought
into action, whilst she would have leisure enough
to arrive at a clear understanding of her own
feelings. It was a pity that the old man should
be ill; but it was lucky for Pansy—and probably
for Caleb—that this call should have been made
upon her.</p>

<p>She had made no sign to her friend; and it
was not until Madge arrived at the gardener’s
cottage on the following afternoon that Pansy’s
sudden departure became known to her. It was
odd that she had not even left a word of good-bye
with her father for one who, she was aware,
would be anxious about her. But the folly,
whatever it might be, which had for the time so
altered the girl’s simple nature would be the more
easily forgotten if there were no speech about it.
Evidently Sam was still ignorant of the fact that
Caleb had spoken and received a refusal. Madge
hoped that they would soon have good news of
Pansy and her patient.</p>

<p>‘I daresay we’ll hear about them in twa or
three days; but it’s little good she can do her
gran’father. He’s a stupid auld body; and as
soon as he gets on his feet again, he’ll just be off
trailing round the town, making-believe to be
selling laces and things; but that’s no what
takes him about.’</p>

<p>‘What, then?’</p>

<p>‘Singing bits o’ sangs and making a fool of
himsel’ at public-houses, for the treats he gets
from folk that ought to know better,’ replied the
gardener, shaking his head gloomily. ‘I havena
much hope for him; but I was aye minded to gie
him another chance; and as it was to be given,
the sooner the better. Besides that, Pansy was
most extraordinary anxious to get awa to him.
If she could just fetch him here, something
might be done for him.’</p>

<p>Madge sympathised with this kindly wish, and
hoped it might be realised in spite of Sam’s
misgivings. Then she went on to the Manor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ROYAL_PERSIAN_SHERBET">ROYAL PERSIAN SHERBET.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> this sounding title, most of us have a
remembrance of a white effervescing powder,
flavoured with essence of lemons, which in the
summer-time was sold to us as children; a large
spoonful was stirred into a tumbler of water, cool
or the reverse, and known to boys as a ‘fizzer.’
It is not to this mawkish draught we wish
to draw the reader’s attention, but rather to the
real thing as used in Persia and throughout the
East. Persian sherbet is a very comprehensive
term, and there are many varieties of it. Before
we come to what it is, it may be as well to
explain when and how it is drunk. Sherbet
is used as a thirst-quencher, and a cooling drink
in hot weather; it is either the drink taken at
meals, or it is handed to visitors in warm weather
in lieu of coffee. As a drink at meals, it is placed
in Chinese porcelain bowls, there being usually
several varieties of the sherbet, more or less,
according to the size of the party and the position
of the host. Each bowl stands in its saucer; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">{439}</span>
across the vessel is laid one of the pear-wood
spoons of Abadeh, famed for their carving and
lightness throughout the Eastern world.</p>

<p>A sherbet spoon is from one to two feet in
length; the bowl, cut from a solid block, holds
from a claret-glass to a tumbler of the liquid.
This bowl is so thin as to be semi-transparent,
and is frequently ornamented with an inscription,
the letters of which are in high-relief. To
retain their semi-transparency, each letter is
undercut, so that, although standing up an eighth
of an inch from the surface of the bowl, yet
the whole is of the same light and delicate texture,
no part thicker than another. One-half of
the surface of the spoon-bowl is covered by two
cleverly applied pieces of carved wood, which
appear to be carved from one block. But this
is not the case—they are really cemented there.
These pieces are carved in such a delicate manner
as to be almost filmy in appearance, resembling
fine lacework. The handle of the spoon—at
times twenty inches long—is formed in a separate
piece, and inserted into the edge of the
bowl in a groove cut to receive it. This handle
is also elaborately carved in delicate tracery;
and a wonderful effect is produced by the
rhomboid-shaped handle, at times four inches
broad at the widest part, and only a tenth of
an inch thick. The groove where the handle
is inserted into the edge of the bowl of the spoon,
and the point of junction, are hidden by a
rosette of carved wood, circular in shape, only
a tenth of an inch thick. This, too, is carved in
lacelike work, and it is cemented to the shaft of
the spoon. A kind of flying buttress of similar
delicate woodwork unites the back-part of the
shaft to the shoulder of the bowl. The spoon,
which when it leaves the carver’s bench is white,
is varnished with <i>Kaman</i> oil, which acts as a
waterproof and preservative, and dyes the whole
of a fine gamboge yellow similar to our boxwood.
The weight of the spoon is in the largest sizes
two ounces.</p>

<p>The tools used by the carver are a plane, a
rough sort of gouge, and a common penknife.
Each spoon is of a separate and original design,
no two being alike, save when ordered in pairs
or sets. The price of the finest specimens is from
five to fifteen shillings each. These sherbet spoons
are really works of art, and are valued by oriental
amateurs. Many of the merchants are very proud
of their sherbet spoons; and being wood, they
are ‘lawful;’ for a metal spoon, if of silver, is
an abomination; consequently, the teaspoons in
Persia have a filigree hole in the bowl, and thus
can be used for stirring the tea only, and not for
the unlawful act of conveying it to the mouth
in a silver spoon. Of course, these high-art
sherbet spoons are only seen at the houses of the
better classes, a coarser wooden spoon being used
by the lower classes. The spoons at dinner serve
as drinking-vessels, for tumblers are unknown;
and the metal drinking-cups so much in use are
merely for travelling, or the pottle-deep potations
of the irreligious.</p>

<p>During the seven months of Persian summer,
it is usual to serve sherbet at all visits, in lieu of
coffee, for coffee is supposed to be heating in the
hot afternoons, at which time formal visits are
often made; and as the visitor must be given
something—for he is never sent empty away—sherbet
in glass tankards or <i>istakans</i>—a word
borrowed from the Russian term for a tumbler—is
handed round. These <i>istakans</i> are often very
handsome, being always of cut or coloured glass,
often elaborately gilded and painted in colours,
or what is termed jewelled—that is, ornamented
with an imitation of gems.</p>

<p>And now, what is Persian sherbet? A draught
of sweetened water flavoured to the taste of the
drinker. The only exception to this definition
is the <i>sherbet-i-kand</i>, or <i>eau sucrée</i>, which is
simply water in which lump-sugar has been
dissolved. The varieties of sherbet may be
divided into those made from the fresh juice of
fruit, which are mixed with water and sweetened
to the taste; and those made from sirup, in
which the juice of fruit has been boiled.</p>

<p>It will be thus seen that the effervescing qualities
of royal Persian sherbet only exist in the
imagination of the English confectioner. But
there is one all-important point that the English
vendor would do well to imitate: Persian sherbet
is served very cool, or iced. Blocks of snow
or lumps of ice are always dissolved in the
sherbet drunk in Persia, unless the water has
been previously artificially cooled. Fresh sherbets
are usually lemon, orange, or pomegranate;
and the first two are particularly delicious. The
fresh juice is expressed in the room in the
presence of the guest, passed through a small
silver strainer, to remove the pips, portions of
pulp, &amp;c.; lumps of sugar are then placed in the
<i>istakan</i>; water is poured in till the vessel is two-thirds
full, and it is then filled to the brim with
blocks of ice or snow.</p>

<p>The preserved sherbets are generally contained
in small decanters of coloured Bohemian glass
similar to the <i>istakans</i> in style. They are in the
form of clear and concentrated sirup. This sirup
is poured into the bowl or <i>istakan</i>, as the case
may be; water is added; the whole is stirred;
and the requisite quantity of ice or snow completes
the sherbet.</p>

<p>When bowls are used—as they invariably are
by the rich at meals, and by the poor at all
times—the spoons are dipped into the bowl, and
after being emptied into the mouth, are replaced
in the bowl of sherbet. Thus the use of glass
vessels, until lately very expensive in Persia, is
dispensed with. Probably with the continuous
introduction of the ugly and cheap, but strong
and serviceable, Russian glass, the dainty sherbet-spoon
of Abadeh will gradually disappear, the
more prosaic tumbler taking its place.</p>

<p>One kind of sherbet is not a fruit-sirup, but
a distilled water; this is the <i>sherbet i-beed-mishk</i>,
or willow-flower sherbet. The fresh flowers of
a particular kind of willow are distilled with
water; a rather insipid but grateful distilled
water is the result. Of this, the Persians are
immoderately fond, and they ascribe great power
to it in the ‘fattening of the thin.’ It is
a popular and harmless drink, and is drunk
in the early morning, not iced, but simply
sweetened.</p>

<p>Persians are very particular as to the water
they drink, and are as great connoisseurs in it
as some Englishmen are curious in wines. The
water they habitually drink must be cool, and
if possible, from a spring of good repute. It is
often brought long distances in skins daily from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">{440}</span>
the favourite spring of the locality. Given good
water, and pleasant, grateful beverages of all
sorts, it is easy to refrain from the strong drinks
which Mohammed so wisely forbade his followers
to indulge in, making drunkenness a crime, and
the drunkard an object of disgust and loathing
to his fellow-man. Undoubtedly, strong drinks
in hot climates, or even in hot weather, are
incompatible with good health.</p>

<p>The varieties of the preserved sirups are
numerous: orange, lemon, quince, cranberry—the
raspberry is unknown in Persia—cherry, pomegranate,
apricot, plum, and grape juice; while
various combinations of a very grateful nature
are made by mixing two or even three of the
above.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TERRIBLY_FULFILLED">TERRIBLY FULFILLED.</h2>
</div>


<h3 title="CHAPTER II.">IN FOUR CHAPTERS.—CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> auctioneer looked at his watch. Past
three o’clock in the morning. He went into
the hall, put on his hat, softly opened the
front-door, and went out. He was going to
make a visit of inspection which no amount of
distress would have induced him to omit before
retiring to rest. The house was a corner one,
turning a dead wall to the side-street which
ran out of the square. Turning down this
street, he stopped at a low door at the further
extremity of the house, having a massive iron
handle and a small keyhole. Taking a key from
his pocket, he turned it in the lock, twisted
the handle round, and, exerting his strength,
drew the door towards him. It was then to
be seen that this door, though to outward view
consisting of nothing stronger than wood, was of
massive steel within—was, in fact, a thief-proof
door. The idea was an original one. Our
brethren who follow the honourable profession
of burglary find, we are told, little difficulty in
dealing with matters of this nature, however
skilfully constructed and widely advertised, if
only they can be secure from interruption. The
mere fact that safes and strong-room doors are
always to be found <i>inside</i> a building, affords
to the burglar this very security. Once within
and alone, with the long hours of night before
him, he can go about his work in a leisurely and
scientific fashion, with at least a fair chance of
success. But it had occurred to the auctioneer
that if the door were made to open directly
upon the street, it would be extremely difficult
for the most daring and experienced cracksman
to prosecute to a successful conclusion, at
the momentary risk of detection, a labour of
several hours, requiring the employment of
numerous tools. Besides which, the police being
aware of the existence of the door, the constable
on the beat was accustomed to examine it carefully
whenever he passed; so that if any attempt
to force it had been made since the last inspection,
he could not fail to detect the fact
immediately.</p>

<p>The auctioneer stepped through the doorway
and shut the door behind him. Striking a match,
he lit the candle in a small lantern which he
carried; and it was then evident that, supposing
our burglar to have forced the outer door, he
would so far have found little to reward his
pains, for a second strong-door at some distance
from the first required to be opened also. This
done, the interior of the safe was seen. It
was a small room, about ten feet square, entirely
without access to the house, the walls and
vaulted ceiling strongly constructed of stone. Its
only furniture was a small table and chair, and
a nest of drawers clamped to the wall. Close
by this, reaching from the floor to the spring of
the arch, was what appeared to be a dingy, full-length
portrait of a gentleman of the time of
Charles II., in a tarnished gilt frame. On inspection,
this picture looked as if painted on panel;
but if sounded with the knuckles, it was found
to be of a different material—solid metal.</p>

<p>Most men, especially rich men, have a hobby.
Mr Cross had two. They were, first, diamonds;
secondly, mechanics. His trade was not of the
ordinary class; and he, with one or two other
firms, had practically a monopoly of it in London.
He dealt only in precious stones, jewellery,
valuable pictures, and such-like articles. To his
rooms, pawnbrokers sent their unredeemed pledges
of this kind for sale by public auction, as the
law directs. Where it was necessary, under the
terms of a will, to dispose of family plate and
jewellery, the executors were generally advised
to retain the services of Mr Cross. Should the
more valuable and less bulky effects of the Right
Honourable the Earl of Englethorpe ever come
to the hammer, as sometimes appeared to that
nobleman to be a not quite impossible occurrence,
it was by no means unlikely—such is the irony
of fate—that Mr Cross would wield the fatal
hammer. In this way it happened that the
auctioneer, being brought into business contact
with dealers in precious stones, enjoyed opportunities
of gratifying his passion for diamonds at
a cost which would have astounded the general
public, who are accustomed to shop-window prices.
During some twenty years, he had expended in
this way over thirty thousand pounds, and had
destined his collection to form a parure for his
daughter on her marriage, which should at least
equal that of any duchess in the three kingdoms.
And it contributed not a little to his grief, that
the possibility of her ever coming to wear those
diamonds seemed to be but a very remote
one.</p>

<p>For the protection of the fruits of his first
hobby, his second had come into play. In his
youth, when the choice of a trade or profession
had been offered to him by his father—also an
auctioneer with a large business—he had elected
to be a mechanical engineer. He had accordingly
been apprenticed to an eminent firm, and
had gone through the drudgery exacted from all,
without distinction of class or means, who enter
that profession, in which there is no royal road
to learning. He had developed such ingenuity
and ability, that there would have been no difficulty
about a future partnership, when his father
died suddenly. It was highly advisable that
the business, a large and lucrative one, should
be carried on. Young Cross, with that decision
of character which marked him through life,
instantly determined to abandon engineering and
adopt his father’s trade, which prospered in his
hands until it reached its present dimensions.
But he never wasted anything; and he turned
his mechanical knowledge and skill to such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">{441}</span>
purpose by way of recreation, that amongst other
sources of wealth he was the owner of several
valuable patents of his own invention. He had
a small workshop and forge fitted up in the rear
of his house, and here he was accustomed often
to occupy himself in the evening and early
morning. It was his only amusement; for of
books he was wont to say, and believe, that
they were but the brains of other men, and
of little use to a man who had brains of his
own.</p>

<p>His next proceedings will show how he had
turned his mechanical genius to account for the
safe keeping of his diamonds. Any person opening
the drawers in the nest would have found
them full of old papers, and would also have
found that they would not come entirely out of
their places. Opening, however, the third drawer
from the top, the auctioneer pulled at it strongly,
until it came out with a sharp snap, exposing
the opening into which it fitted. The back of
this drawer was a movable flap, working on
hinges, and retained in its place by a powerful
spring, so that it required a considerable exertion
of strength to extract the drawer from the nest.
Putting his hand into the aperture, Mr Cross
grasped an iron semicircular handle which fitted
into a niche in the wall at the back of the drawers,
and drew it towards him. As he did so, the
seeming picture glided noiselessly away, leaving
its frame surrounding a dark opening. Through
this he passed into what was in effect a huge
inner safe; a closet about four feet square by six
in height, lined throughout with inch-thick steel,
and within that again with four inches of fire-resisting
composition contained in an iron skin.
The sliding door was steel, very thick and massive,
fastening with half-a-dozen spring catches,
moving in a groove four inches in depth, and
absolutely impervious to any one not acquainted
with the machinery.</p>

<p>Every portion of this latter apparatus had been
devised and constructed by the auctioneer with
his own hands, and placed in position by him
after the safe—made to his order by a famous
maker—had been set up. The rest was a mere
matter of stone-masonry, completed by ordinary
workmen under his own eye; so that the secret
was with him alone. Even now the whole has
not been revealed. Prior to withdrawing the
semicircular handle, it was necessary to turn it
to the right, from a perpendicular to a horizontal
position. Unless this were done, the act of pulling
out the handle set in motion a clockwork
apparatus, which at the end of thirty seconds
released a heavy counterpoise, the effect of which
was to close the sliding door of the inner safe
smartly, and to throw out of gear the machinery
which worked it. It could then only be opened
by means of a second mechanical arrangement,
connected with another handle which was concealed
behind a block of stone in the wall near
the roof. It is evident that any person entering
the safe after opening the door, unless in possession
of the second part of this secret, would
be effectually trapped. His comrades, if any,
would be unable to deliver him, and he would
have to abide an ignominious capture. This
device the auctioneer considered superior to any
system of spring-guns or such-like vulgarities,
which are almost as likely to injure the owner
as the thief. Against each side of the safe were
piled ordinary deed-boxes, containing the various
securities representing the bulk of his fortune;
but against the side opposite to the door was an
iron box weighing perhaps five hundredweight,
and clamped firmly to the floor.</p>

<p>The auctioneer knelt down, and with a small
key fastened to the handle of the larger one,
opened the box, disclosing a number of jewel-trays.
As he lifted them out one after the other,
the light of the lantern twinkled upon the rare
and valuable gems, of all sizes and shapes, which
lay loose upon the satin cushions. He looked at
them long and earnestly, counting them over and
over again, and flashing the more precious of
them to and fro against the light.</p>

<p>‘Ay!’ he muttered—‘all for her—for little
Amy. What use in them now? It’s all over—all
over and done with for ever.’ But again
came the thought that if Amy were to become
a widow, she might wear the diamonds after
all.</p>

<p>He closed and locked the box, rose from his
knees, and went back to the nest of drawers
outside. As he forced the handle into its place,
the picture reappeared, and the sliding-door shut
to with a click. Pushing back the movable flap,
he insinuated the drawer into its place, replaced
the papers taken from it, and closed it. Then,
closing the inner strong-door, he stepped again
into the street, shutting the outer door after
him; and having satisfied himself that it was
securely closed, went into the house and to bed,
where he slept heavily, being quite tired out,
until nearly ten o’clock in the morning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Despite his vigils of the night before, Mr Cross
was tolerably punctual to his eleven o’clock
appointment at the rooms occupied by Captain
Ferrard and his wife in Duke Street. That
gentleman received him with smooth looks and
fair words, for it was by no means his cue to
be the first to quarrel. So he courteously hoped
that Mr Cross was well, invited him to a seat,
making no allusion to the fact that this was the
first time they had met since the marriage,
and then left his visitor to state the reason of
his call.</p>

<p>‘I’m a plain business man, sir,’ said the
auctioneer after a moment or two; ‘and I’ve got
little time to spare, so I’ll come to the point at
once. It seems, from what my daughter told me
last night, that you and she don’t get on quite so
well together as you should.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay!’ said the captain carelessly. The
demon within him was being aroused. He had
not the slightest intention of allowing this
tradesman to lecture him. The latter waited
for some further remark, but none came.</p>

<p>‘That isn’t as it should be between man and
wife, you know,’ said he at last, somewhat
nonplussed.</p>

<p>‘I’ll be as plain with you, Mr Cross, as you
can possibly be with me,’ said the captain, turning
round suddenly so as to face his visitor. ‘My
wife has been complaining to you, it seems. Well,
I suppose we have our trifling disagreements,
like other couples, and scarcity of money does
not tend to sweeten the temper—does it? I quite
agree with you that this is not as it should be;
but then, how few things are! Am I to suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">{442}</span>
that it is only on this subject that you wish to
speak to me?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be hasty,’ replied Mr Cross. ‘I’m not
saying it’s your fault, nor anybody’s fault. I
come to you in a friendly way, not to have words
about it. I’ve been thinking the matter over a
good deal since last night, and I’ve come to fancy
things might somehow be arranged between us,
after all.’</p>

<p>Ferrard pricked up his ears. ‘Very good of
you to say so,’ he said politely.</p>

<p>‘I don’t say that I’ve quite thought it out, and
I don’t say what I will do, you understand, or
what I won’t. But no doubt there’s a good
deal of truth in your remark about money and
temper. I’m a rough, cross-grained sort of
fellow, and perhaps I may have been too quick
over this affair. I’m afraid I wasn’t too civil
to you that day; and you must own <i>you</i> were
a bit aggravating too. I only want my girl to
be happy.’</p>

<p>‘I assure you, Mr Cross,’ said the captain, with
engaging frankness, ‘that in that respect we are
entirely at one. I have every desire for your
daughter’s happiness—and, I may add, for my
own; of course, in a secondary degree. But I
have already pointed out to you, and you have
been good enough to agree with me, that good
temper and easy circumstances are intimately
allied; and I think you will also admit that bad
temper and happiness are entirely incompatible.
And considering our respective tastes and habits,
five hundred a year can scarcely be considered
affluence.’</p>

<p>For all his desire to be conciliatory, he could
not entirely repress the slight sneer which pervaded
his tone and manner.</p>

<p>The auctioneer looked steadily and gravely at
him as he replied: ‘I daresay we shall find some
way of getting rid of the inconvenience, sir. But
I’m due in the City long before this, so I’ll only
say that I hope we shall be better acquainted,
and we can’t be that without seeing more of one
another. What do you say to a bit of dinner at
my house on Thursday and staying the night?
Then you and I can talk this little matter over
by ourselves, between man and man. I’m going
out of town for a week on Friday; and if you
don’t mind, I’ll arrange for Amy to meet me at
London Bridge and keep me company—she looks
as if a whiff of the sea wouldn’t hurt her—and
then, you know, you could think over any proposal
I might make to you, alone and quietly; and
tell me what you say to it, when we come back.’</p>

<p>The captain’s heart leaped within him at these
proposals. Pressing claims were at this moment
hanging over him, which it seemed that he
might now be able to meet. He could ask no
fairer opportunity for captivating his father-in-law
and so turning his dearth into plenty. So
he responded to the invitation with great heartiness,
professed himself delighted at the prospect
of so pleasant a trip for his wife; and they
shook hands and parted.</p>

<p>Mr Cross stood on the doorstep for a moment,
deep in thought. His mind sadly misgave him.
He mistrusted his power of dealing with this cool,
sarcastic, easy-mannered vagabond, as he would
have dealt with one of his own class. He shook
his head as he walked away. If the man would
but die!</p>

<p>That night, feeling weary and worn out, he
thought he would indulge in a little tinkering of
some sort in his workshop—to him a never-failing
source of relaxation. For some time past he had
been engaged in making a duplicate set of keys
for the doors of the strong-room and the iron box
which held the diamonds, as a useful precaution
in case the originals should be lost or mislaid.
So, after dinner, he put on his leathern apron
and again set to work, pipe in mouth. When
he had finished the work, he paid the usual
evening visit to his diamonds, using the new keys.
With a touch or two of the small file which he
carried in his hand, he found that they fitted
perfectly.</p>

<p>Amy had been the same day to her father in
the City, all anxiety to learn the result of the
interview, as her husband declined to tell her
anything. Mr Cross had, as we know, but little
to tell; he could only bid her, as before,
keep a good heart, and it would all come right.
He informed her of the arrangements which had
been made for Thursday and Friday next, named
the hour at which she was to meet him at
London Bridge, and sent her away a little perplexed,
but rejoicing greatly at the prospect of
the trip, and trusting implicitly in her father’s
wisdom.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ART_OF_CONVERSATION">THE ART OF CONVERSATION.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Certain</span> things are supposed to come by the
grace of nature and the free gift of providence;
and the Art of Conversation is one of them.
No one dreams of cultivating this art, either in
its perfected form or in those rudiments which
stand as a ‘grammar in use for beginners;’ that
is—correct diction, just expression, that inflection
of the voice which shall be eloquent without
being theatrical, and that emphasis which shall
be indicative without being exaggerated. People
drawl out their words into long tails or clip
them into docked stumps; they loop them on
to the other with a running chain of ‘<i>er</i>s,’
or they bite them off short, each word falling
plumb and isolated, disconnected from all the
rest; they let their labials go by the board, and
bury their <i>r</i>s in the recesses of their larynx;
they throw the accent on the wrong syllable,
and transform their vowels according to their
liking; they say ‘wuz’ for ‘was,’ ‘onnibus’ for
‘omnibus,’ and ‘y’ are’ for ‘you are;’ they
shoulder out all the middle aspirates and some
of the initial, and forget that words ending
in ‘ing’ have a final <i>g</i> which is neither to be
burked out of existence nor hardened into a
ringing <i>k</i>. All which lingual misdemeanours
they commit with a clear conscience and a light
heart, because ignorant that they have committed
any misdemeanour at all.</p>

<p>Even people of birth and breeding, who should
be without offence in those matters, fail in their
grammar, and say the queerest things in the
world. ‘These sort of things;’ ‘Who have you
asked?’ ‘Every one of them know you;’
‘Between you and I;’ ‘Neither men or women;’
‘No one’ as the antecedent, and ‘they’ as the
relative—these are just a few of the commonest
errors of daily speech of which no one is ashamed,
and to which were you to make a formal objection,
you would be thought a pedant for your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">{443}</span>
pains, and laughed at when your back was turned.
If these things are done in the green tree of
method, what may not be looked for in the dry
of substance? And sure it is that we find very
queer things indeed in that dry of substance, and
prove for ourselves how the Art of Conversation
is reduced to its primitive elements, which
few give themselves the trouble to embellish, and
fewer still to perfect.</p>

<p>To begin at the beginning, how seldom people
pay undivided attention to the conversation on
hand, and how often their thoughts wander and
stray everywhere but where they should be!
The most absurd, the most trivial, thing distracts
them. A spider on the wall breaks the thread of
an enthralling narrative, and a butterfly on the
lawn breaks into the gravest, or the most poetic,
talk as ruthlessly as the proverbial bull smashes
into the proverbial china-shop. Another alumnus
in the same school, though of a different class,
will not let you speak without interruption.
Like a cockerel, spurring and springing at its
brother, this kind dashes at you with an answer
before you have half stated your case. ‘You
mean this?’ he says, performing that feat called
‘taking the words out of your mouth.’ And
forthwith he begins his refutation of that which
you have not said and probably had no intention
of saying. Another will not wait until you
have finished. His words cross and intermingle
with yours in hopeless confusion of both sound
and sense. You both speak together, and neither
listens to the other—you, because you ‘have the
floor,’ and he, because he wishes to have it.
Conversation with such is impossible. It is
a battle of words—mere words—like a heap of
loose stones shot pell-mell out of a cart; and not
that orderly interchange of ideas which is what
true conversation should be.</p>

<p>Others, cousins-german to these, interfere in
talk with which they have no business. They
do not join in; thus enlarging the basis and
enriching the superstructure; but they break in
with something quite irrelevant, destroying the
most interesting discussion on the most puerile
pretence, as a feather whisk might knock down a
Sèvres vase. This form of bad-breeding is much
in use among women when they are jealous, and
want to make themselves unpleasant to each
other. The poet or the lord, the bishop or the
general, that grand name or this great fortune—the
man who is the feminine cynosure and
whose attention confers distinction—is talking
to some one singled out from the rest. He
has to be detached and made to transfer
himself. Accordingly, one of the boldest of
the discontented outsiders goes up to the charge,
and in the midst of a talk on literature, art,
politics, on his travels or her experiences, cuts
in with a question about the next flower-show
or the last murder; with Who? What?
When? How? no nearer to the subject on hand
than the moon is near to Middlesex. This is an
offence of daily occurrence, even among well-bred
people—human nature having the ugly trick of
breaking out of the delicate swaddling-clothes
in which education and refinement would fain
confine it.</p>

<p>Sometimes your interlocutor is a mother
abnormally occupied with her children, and
unable for two consecutive minutes to free her
thoughts from the petty details of their lives.
She does not even pretend to listen to what
you are saying. All the time you are speaking,
her eyes are wandering about the room, to make
sure that Tom is not forgetting his manners,
and that Jane is not making holes in hers—that
Frank is where he should be, and Sarah not
where she should not be—that Edith is not
talking too much, and that Charley is not talking
too little: it does not matter what she is anxious
about, seeing that if it be not one thing it will
be another. And you need not be offended, nor
take her inattention as a slight special to yourself.
The Golden-mouthed himself could not fix
her thoughts, wandering as they always are over
the pathless spaces of her maternal fear. She is
one of the most disagreeable of the whole tribe
of the conversational awkward-squad. You have
nothing for it but to stop dead—in the midst
of a sentence, if need be—until she has brought
her roving eyes back to the point which presupposes
attention, and appears to be conscious
that you are speaking to her.</p>

<p>Others yawn in your face with frank and
undisguised weariness; and some put up the
transparent screen of a fan or two fingers; others,
again, make that constrained grimace which
accompanies the eating and the swallowing of the
yawn, and think that their sudden gulp and
hesitation will pass unobserved. Some give
wrong answers, with their eyes fixed on yours,
as if listening devoutly to all you say, and
absorbed in your conversation. They have
mastered this part of the form, and can look as
if drinking in to the last verbal drop. The
reality is analogous to that condition of Baron
Münchhausen’s horse with which we are all familiar,
and which we express by the phrase: ‘Going
in at one ear and out by another.’ One who
had learned this art of looking attention without
giving it, once fell into a pit whence was no
possible extraction. ‘Do you call gentlemen in
England It?’ said an English-speaking German
who thought his sweet companion had been
entirely interested in his talk. Her eyes—and
what eyes they were!—had been all he could
desire—fixed, listening, interested. Meanwhile,
her ears had been occupied elsewhere. At her
back, on the ottoman where she was sitting,
was being carried on a conversation in which
she was deeply interested. Before her sat her
German, labouring heavily among the stiff clay-clods
of his imperfect English. Her answer to
his remark betrayed the absence of the mind
underneath all the steadfastness of her bewildering
eyes. ‘Do you call gentlemen in England
It?’ he repeated with mingled reproach, sorrow,
and—enlightenment. That random answer to
his previous question cost her the offer of a spray
of orange blossom—and him the pain of its
refusal.</p>

<p>Beyond these rudiments comes the higher art
reaching into grace, and needing enlightened
intelligence for its perfection. The section which
we have been considering belongs only to the
grammar, the beginning, the mere infancy of
things, like the New Zealander’s tattoo for personal
decoration, or his hideous idol for representative
art. Beyond the good-breeding of
attention comes the supreme art, we had almost
said the science of conversation—of all things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">{444}</span>
the most difficult, to judge by its rarity at least
in England. It is more common in France,
where it is better understood, and where a
good conversationalist is prized as a Master in
his own degree. And be it observed—a good
conversationalist is not the same thing as a
good anecdotist, a good debater, a good talker—this
last too often sinning with Coleridge in
monopolising all the talk to himself, and granting
only some ‘brilliant flashes of silence’ wherein
the ruck may have their innings. A good
conversationalist, on the contrary, is essentially
reciprocal. He flings his own ball, but he
catches the return and waits for its throw. He
has a light touch, and that kind of skill which
glances off rather than hits fair and square. He
has also the power of suggestiveness and direction,
as perfect in its way as the skill with which
certain adepts can make a ball wind in and out of
stumps and stakes by the clever twist of their
first throw off. He is not one of those who run
a subject to earth and finish it all the same as
one would finish a fox; but he keeps it alive
and going with the neatest, deftest, little fillips
possible—as the Japanese keep up their paper
butterflies with airy puffs of their flimsy fans,
or as a thaumaturgist guides his spinning-plates
with the tip of his forefinger. When it is all
over, and you ask yourself what you have got
by it, you are forced to confess, Nothing. You
have been superficially amused, and for the
moment interested; but you have learned nothing,
and are no richer mentally than you were
before the verbal butterfly began to flutter and
the wordy plate to spin.</p>

<p>We in England, however, know but little of
this kind of talk. We have men who argue, and
men who assert; and we have men, and women
too, who come down with a thud on the toes
of all whom they encounter in the various
walks of conversation. But of the light bright
thrust and parry, the brilliant quarte and tierce,
the flashing ‘pinked’ and quick <i>riposte</i> characteristic
of the palmy days of Parisian society,
we have but very little. For foils we use
bludgeons; for paper butterflies, leaden bullets.
We are too much in earnest to be graceful, and
too anxious about our subject to be careful of
our method. Hence we have better dialecticians
than conversationalists, and better fighters than
fencers. But really, say, at a dinner, or in the
crowded corners of a fashionable soirée, you
cannot go into the mazes of ‘evidences,’ nor
discuss the value of esoteric Buddhism, nor
yet winnow your sheaf of political economy,
beginning with Adam Smith and ending with
Henry George. You can only play with words
and toss up airy bubbles of ideas. And he who
can play with most dexterity, and whose airy
bubbles have the brightest iridescence, is the
hero of the moment and the master of the
situation.</p>

<p>As a rule, authors are but dull dogs in conversation.
They keep their good things for
their books. Those who expect in literary
society the feast of reason and the flow of
soul, find themselves for the most part wofully
disappointed. More is to be got out of the
amateurist set—that fringe which would be if
it could, and which hangs on to the main body
as the best thing it can do in the circumstances.
But authors of the professional and bread-winning
class will talk only of things already known,
repeating what they have written, but taking
care not to forestall what they have not yet
printed. They, and all professionals of any
denomination whatsoever, are also given to talk
shop among themselves; and shop is usually
disagreeable to the outsider.</p>

<p>We might do worse than cultivate Conversation
as an Art. Time has room for all things
in his hand, and life has need of variety. Desperately
busy and terribly in earnest as we may be,
blowing bubbles has yet its value. Moreover,
the true art of conversation is a lesson in good-breeding,
which, in its turn, is the <i>fine fleur</i> of
civilisation; and thus, from the rootwork of
manner to the efflorescence of matter, there is
something to be gained by the perfection of the
art.</p>

<h3 title="PART I.">IN TWO PARTS.—PART I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the following account of what happened to me
a few years ago serves no other purpose, it may
pass muster as an illustration of two old sayings,
namely, that ‘One half of the world does not
know how the other half lives,’ and that ‘Truth
is often stranger than fiction.’</p>

<p>It was late on a very cold afternoon during
the winter of 1876-77, that I was hurrying westward
along the Marylebone Road, congratulating
myself upon having turned my back upon the
bitter east wind, and comparing the climate of
London towards the end of December with that
which I had been enjoying exactly twelve months
previously, when at Calcutta, as one of the Special
Correspondents with the Prince of Wales. I had
got nearly as far as the Edgware Road, when a
man touched his hat to me and asked me for
the wherewith to get a night’s lodging. He did
not look like an ordinary or a professional beggar.
His clothes, although very shabby, were evidently
well made. He looked so pinched and weary,
that I stopped and fumbled in the ticket-pocket
of my overcoat for a sixpence to give him. He
stared at me very hard indeed whilst I was
getting the money, and as I handed it to him,
broke out with an exclamation of wonder, asking
me whether my name was not so-and-so. I
replied that it was; and asked him where he had
ever seen me before. To make a long story
short, this poverty-stricken man asking alms on
the public streets turned out to be a gentleman
I had known many years before, when he was a
captain in one of our crack lancer regiments, and
had a private fortune of his own of more than
fifteen hundred a year. When I had last seen
him, he was a man of little over thirty; but was
now on the wrong side of fifty; and owing to
want, care, hunger, cold, and dirt, looked very
much older. He had always been a very fast
man. Betting, cards, and doing bills at sixty
per cent., had worked out their legitimate ends
upon him. I had lost all sight of him for fully
twenty years, but remembered having heard that
he had been obliged to sell out on account of
his many debts. All this, and much more too,
he related when he came to my house, as I had
told him to do, and helped him as far as it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">{445}</span>
in my power, with a little money and some old
clothes.</p>

<p>When I asked him what he intended to do
for the future, he said that if he could only get
a decent outfit and a few pounds for travelling
expenses, he had an opening in Paris that would
soon put him on his legs again. It so happened
that I knew slightly two or three men who had
been in the same regiment with this individual;
and of these there was one who was very well
off. I therefore wrote out an appeal for the
poor fellow, sent it to the different parties; and
was greatly pleased when I found that instead of
realising, as I had hoped, some ten or fifteen
pounds, the contributions sent me came to upwards
of thirty pounds. With this money I first
got the unfortunate man a fairly good outfit of
clothes, and then made over to him the balance
left, about six pounds, to use as he liked. He
was exceedingly grateful; and asked me to
express his thanks to those who had responded
so generously to my letters. It was about a
fortnight after I had met him on the Marylebone
Road that he called to bid me farewell, and to
thank me again for all I had done, which, after
all, was merely having written some half-dozen
letters, and taken a little trouble in getting his
clothes as good and as cheap as I could. He
told me that he was leaving for Paris that
evening.</p>

<p>For five or six months I neither saw nor heard
anything about him. At the end of that time
I received a note from this individual, telling me
he was in London, saying he would like to see
me, and giving me his address at a respectable
hotel near Leicester Square. I wrote an answer;
and as I happened to be going into the neighbourhood,
called at the hotel, intending to leave
it there. But as the waiter told me that the
gentleman was at home, and was then writing
in the coffee-room, I went there, and found my
former acquaintance, who seemed delighted to
see me. He had evidently prospered since I last
saw him. He was well, if perhaps somewhat
flashily dressed; had what seemed to be a valuable
pin in his neck-scarf, a thick gold chain
from one waistcoat pocket to another, and two
or three rings on his fingers. He looked more
like a Frenchman than an Englishman; and
would certainly have passed a better muster
at Brebant’s or in the <i>Café du Helder</i> than he
could have done in a London club. But what
showed more plainly than anything else that he
had done well, and what pleased me greatly, was
that he there and then pulled out a roll of bank-notes
and insisted upon repaying me what I had
collected for him from his former friends. It
was in vain that I protested that those gentlemen
had parted with their money as a gift and not
as a loan; that I did not know where to find
them at present; and that I begged he would
not think of repaying me the small portion I had
contributed to the amount. No; nothing would
serve him but to make me take the money and
to give it back as best I could to those who had
assisted him in his great distress.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, I was very curious to
know by what means he had, in some measure at
anyrate, recovered his position in the world; or
how he had managed to fill his empty purse. But
to all my questions he gave the most evasive
answers. Remembering what his pursuits used
to be long ago, I felt certain that he had got
into some lucky vein of play or of betting, and
that he was making a living either by cards
or on the racecourse. But after a few days’
observation of what he did, I was sure that
I was labouring under a mistake. Just at that
time of the year several of our great race-meetings
were in full swing; but he never went
near any of them; nor did he ever attempt to
go back amongst the men who had been his
companions long ago. I offered to get his name
put down as an honorary or visiting member of
one or two good clubs; but he invariably declined.
When he asked me, as he often did, to dine
with him, it was always at one or other of the
best foreign restaurants in London. When I
called on him at his hotel, he seemed to be
always busy either writing or receiving letters.
One night I looked him up about eleven <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on
my way back from the theatre. But they told
me at the hotel he always went out between
nine and ten <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and seldom came back
before the small-hours of the morning.</p>

<p>In London, a busy man has little or no time
to think of any one’s affairs except his own; but
I confess that this gentleman used often to puzzle
me not a little. His seeming prosperity in money
matters as compared with his former circumstances,
and the singular life he led, caused me
often to wonder what were the sources whence
he derived his income, my curiosity being not a
little increased by his evident desire to keep me
in the dark as to the truth of the case. But
the solution of a difficult social problem almost
invariably comes to hand when least expected,
and this case was no exception to the rule.</p>

<p>I had not seen my friend for some two or
three weeks, when I received a note asking me
to call upon him, as he had met with a bad
accident and was confined to his bed. I accordingly
went to see him; and found that he had
slipped upon the street, had injured his knee
somewhat severely, and was suffering great pain.
He had called in a surgeon, who had ordered the
most perfect rest for at least ten days or a
fortnight; and having no other friend in London
of whom he could ask a favour, he begged me to
help him in certain matters of business which
could not be neglected. As a matter of course,
I offered to be of any service I could to him;
and he said that the first favour he would ask of
me was to go to a small news-agent near Soho
Square and ask for any letters directed to ‘T. D.;
to be left till called for.’</p>

<p>I did so; and found there four letters so
addressed, all bearing French post-marks, and
took them to him at the hotel. He opened
them with evident eagerness, and read them
with an anxiety which he could not disguise from
me, although he very evidently tried his best
to do so. The contents of these communications
seemed to give him great annoyance. After a
short time, during which he seemed deep in
thought, he wrote out a curious, mysterious
advertisement, such as we read almost every day
in the ‘Agony column’ of the <i>Times</i>, and asked
me to get it inserted in three of the chief morning
papers. I read what he had written, and
wondered not a little what he meant. In the
advertisement, ‘Adventure’ was requested to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">{446}</span>
‘keep dark until Phillip wrote.’ The sick man
saw me smile as I read it, and looked very
anxious and embarrassed, assuring me that there
was no harm whatever in the hidden meaning
of the notice. Having work of my own to attend
to, I left him, saying I would call again the next
day. But he begged so earnestly for me to come
before post-time, that I consented to do so. He
told me that he did not like intrusting his letters
to the people of the hotel, who were either
very curious or extremely neglectful on all such
matters. I therefore returned in the afternoon,
when he handed me two letters, which he asked
me to post. They were both addressed to Paris,
to persons with French-like names, and were
to be left <i>poste restante</i> at different post-offices.
The next day but one he asked me to go to
the same small news-agent near Soho Square
and ask for any letters that might be there for
him. I found two, and brought them to him.
He read them with great eagerness; and again
wrote two letters, which he asked me to post for
him, evidently not caring to trust the people of
the hotel with his correspondence. This went
on almost every day. On one occasion, he took
out of one of the letters I brought him a draft
from a Paris bank upon one in London for one
hundred pounds payable to ‘T. C. Dane, or order.’
He indorsed it, and asked me to get it cashed
for him, which I did. He evidently saw that
I was not only puzzled as to what his mysterious
business could be, but that I had serious thoughts
of not coming near him again until I found out
whether my doing so would compromise myself.
And apparently acting upon a sudden impulse,
he all at once opened out and made what I may
call his confession to me.</p>

<p>‘For some time past,’ he began, ‘I have seen
that you wonder what my business is, and why
I am so mysterious with regard to what I do
and what I write. Well, I will now make a
clean breast of it.’</p>

<p>He then told me that some two or three
years previously, he had got into what he called
‘worse than a mess’ in Paris. He had somehow
got mixed up with a gang of card-sharpers, without
knowing to what an extent they carried on
their dishonest practices, and had so far compromised
himself, that the French police had
him at their mercy. They had, however, let
him off, holding over him the power they had
to prosecute him at any future time, should they
think he deserved it. But they made certain
conditions with him; and these were, that he
should go to London, and furnish them from
time to time with all the information he could
gather respecting certain receivers of goods, stolen
in France, who resided in this metropolis. In
order to do this the more effectually, he had
managed not only to get acquainted with the
leaders of a gang which worked for their friends
in Paris, but he had also got himself received
as one of them, and used to go to their meetings
almost every night. The work, as he told me,
had been most unpleasant, but it was nearly
at an end; and the French police had promised
that he should very soon be altogether free from
his engagements with them.</p>

<p>To mix with people of whom little or nothing
is known, and to penetrate into places which
are hidden from the generality of mankind, has
always had a great charm for me. Mr Dane
was not a little surprised when, instead of leaving
him after I had heard his story, I told him he
would do me a great favour if he took me to a
meeting of his dishonest friends; and that I
would pledge myself never to give any information
that might lead to a single member of the
band getting into trouble. After making some
objections to my request, he at last consented;
and said that the first night he could get out he
would go to the meeting of the gang by himself,
but would then make arrangements for me to
accompany him the following evening. And
thus it was that I managed to get into very
‘queer company.’</p>

<p>If any one was to offer me one hundred pounds
to show him where the place in which the thieves
and receivers of stolen goods is or was situated,
I could not do so, even if it was honourable to
divulge what I had promised faithfully to keep
secret. This much I may say, that having dined
in the Strand, we walked up Catherine Street,
and turned to the right when we came to the
court that flanks the south side of Drury Lane
Theatre. Here my companion stopped, took out
of his pocket a pair of spectacles, and said I
must put them on before he could take me any
farther. I did as he desired; and found the
glasses to be so dark that I could not see an
inch beyond my nose. My friend laughed; and
linking his arm in mine, said he would conduct
me safely; but that he was obliged to make it
a point I should not be able to recognise the
streets we passed through, even if I wanted to do
so. As near as I could guess, we took some ten
minutes to reach our destination, after I had put
on the glasses. My companion then stopped,
knocked in a peculiar manner at a street door,
told me to take off the spectacles, and led me
through what seemed to be a coffee-shop of the
most humble kind. In a large room beyond this,
there were seated six or seven men, who were
not by any means all of the same type. Two or
three were evidently Frenchmen, and were talking
together with the usual volubility of their nation.
The rest were scattered here and there. All were
smoking. Some had cups of tea or coffee before
them, whilst others seemed to be indulging in
spirits-and-water. My companion was greeted by
all present as a friend they had been waiting
for and were glad to see. He introduced me to
the party assembled as ‘one of us, just come
from Paris.’ No questions were asked, nor,
beyond one or two civil inquiries, was any particular
notice taken of me. I was asked what
I would drink, offered my choice of cigars or
cigarettes; and then the meeting commenced to
discuss, in an informal kind of manner, the business
which had brought those present together.</p>

<p>From what I could gather, it seemed that there
had been, a few days before, a robbery of valuable
jewels in Paris; and that the difficulty of those
connected with the affair was to get the plunder
safely over to the United States. The London
police had been put on the alert; but the thieves—or
shall I call them the agents and helpers of
thieves?—did not seem to fear them. They discussed
very freely the relative merits of the French
and English detective systems; saying, that in
cases of housebreaking and murders, the latter
rarely failed to bring the offenders to justice; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">{447}</span>
that in cases of clever ‘plants,’ the former were
much more to be feared.</p>

<p>‘You never know,’ said one Englishman present,
with a round oath, ‘where or when you may
come across those horrible French spies. Why,
we might have here, in the very midst of us,
some one who is in their pay.’</p>

<p>I thought to myself how little these fellows
knew that my friend who had introduced me
into the room belonged to the very tribe whom
they feared so much. But of the United States
they spoke in the highest terms; or in very much
the same manner that an artisan who could not
earn the wherewith to pay for dry bread in this
country, might praise some place in the Far West
where industry was certain to gain an honest
living. From what I gathered, it would seem that
whenever a robbery on a large scale is carried
out, the first object of those concerned is to get
‘the swag’ out of the country as soon as possible.
Thus, the produce of a plunder in Paris is almost
invariably taken to London, and <i>vice versâ</i>. If
the thieves can so arrange beforehand as to get
away from where the theft has been committed
within a few hours of the completion of their
handiwork, they believe themselves to be all but
safe, or at least the chances are about five to one
in their favour. If they have the luck to get clear
of Europe and safely land in America, the chances
are that they will get clear altogether, realise
a good price for their plunder, and make things
pleasant all round. The United States, as I said
before, is a capital country to go to; but South
America is still better. In neither of these parts
are many questions asked; but in the latter
country the prices given are higher than in the
north, and sales are more readily effected. In
London, the market for jewelry is by no means
good; for, as a rule, the stones have to be taken
out of the setting; and the latter has to be
secreted or instantly melted, else the police are
pretty certain to get scent of the affair.</p>

<p>It must not be thought that those composing
the very singular company amongst whom I
found myself were at all in the burglar line.
I don’t believe that there was a single housebreaking
implement to be found amongst them.
From all I gathered, they were the receivers,
and not the actual robbers, of valuable goods.
They talked together of their common pursuit
much in the same manner that so many brokers
might converse respecting the fluctuations of the
Stock Exchange, or a party of farmers might
give their opinions respecting the coming corn
or other crops. What surprised me most was
the manner in which the company, one and all,
spoke of what they called their ‘business,’ as if it
was of the most legitimate kind; and I feel certain
that they would have resented warmly the words
of any one who threw the shadow of a doubt upon
the propriety of their occupation. In what they
said of things in general, they all appeared to be
very much of the same way of thinking; or, at anyrate,
they expressed themselves as holding very
much the same views. On one subject only did I
hear strong language expressed, and that was when
one of them—who, from what he said, seemed
to have come from France very recently—gave
an account of the manner in which the Paris
detectives had found out a certain robbery, and
had brought those who had perpetrated the same
to justice. For individuals in the pay of the
police, or rather who belonged to the same, to
disguise themselves and mix with the individuals
who were more or less ‘wanted,’ they regarded
as ‘low’ and ‘sneaking’ in the extreme. They
were unanimous in their opinion that if the
French system of detecting robberies was ever
introduced into England, this ‘would no longer’—as
one of the party expressed himself—‘be a
country for any honest man to live in.’</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">So</span> much information about everything is now
so easily obtainable, that there is little excuse for
enduring many of the small domestic worries to
which housekeepers and others are often subjected.
Why, for instance, need any one be inconvenienced
by damp cupboards, when we read that a bowl
of quicklime placed therein will speedily absorb
the moisture? Some of us are nervous about beds
not being well aired, and yet we have only to fill
a large stone bottle with boiling water and put
it into the bed, pressing the bolster and pillows
round it in a heap. By this simple contrivance, it
is comforting to learn, no one need fear giving
a friend a damp bed, even if this is done only
once a fortnight.</p>

<p>Flies are a familiar nuisance; but we are told
of a foreign remedy in laurel oil, which, better
than glass fly-catchers and others, will not only
rid us of these pests, but preserves looking-glasses
and picture-frames when coated with it.
Jane the ‘help’ should derive satisfaction from
the assurance that beetles may be effectually got
rid of by sprinkling once or twice on the floor
a mixture of pure carbolic acid and water, one
part to ten.</p>

<p>It is not frequenters of restaurants only who
wonder why the simple precaution of throwing
red pepper pods or a few pieces of charcoal into
the pan—said to prevent odours from boiling-ham,
cabbage, &amp;c.—is not oftener observed.
Cooks are further reminded that in roasting meat,
salt should not be put upon the joint before it
is put in the oven, as salt extracts the juice; and
that lime-water will improve the condition of old
potatoes in boiling.</p>

<p>Eggs could be purchased with greater confidence
if the German method of preserving them by
means of silicate of soda was generally followed.
A small quantity of the clear sirup solution is
smeared over the surface of the shell. On drying,
a thin, hard, glassy film remains, which serves
as an admirable protection and substitute for wax,
oil, gums, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Economy in housekeeping would be facilitated
by the better observance of what are known in
common parlance as ‘wrinkles.’ For example,
why purchase inferior nutmegs, when their quality
can be tested by pricking them with a pin? If
they are good, the oil will instantly spread around
the puncture. It is worth recollecting that bar-soap
should be cut into square pieces, and put
in a dry place, as it lasts better after shrinking.
If we wish to keep lemons fresh for some time,
we have only to place them in a jar of water and
change it every morning. In selecting flour, we
are advised to look to the colour. If it is white
with a yellowish straw-colour tint, we should buy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">{448}</span>
it; but if it is white with a bluish cast, or with
black specks, we should refuse it.</p>

<p>Broken china can be mended with a useful
glutine made with a piece of old cheese mixed
with lime; and the wooden palings of the garden
may be preserved from the weather by coating
them with a composition of boiled linseed oil and
pulverised charcoal, mixed to the consistence of
paint. In this way wood can be made to last
longer than iron in the ground. If we consult
our health, we should plant the garden with
odoriferous plants such as wall-flowers, mignonette,
and other old English flowers and herbs, which
have a remarkable power of developing ozone and
purifying the atmosphere from miasmatic poisons.</p>

<p>Amateur joiners may derive comfort from the
knowledge that nails and screws if rubbed with
a little soap are easily driven into hard wood.
The same household commodity, of a fine white
quality, if rubbed over new linen will enable it
to be more easily embroidered, as it prevents the
threads from cracking.</p>

<p>A deal of breakage amongst glass and crockery
can be prevented by the simple precaution of
placing lamp-chimneys, tumblers, and such articles
in a pot filled with cold water to which some
common table-salt has been added. Boil the water
well, and then allow it to cool slowly. When
the articles are taken out and washed, they will
resist any sudden changes of temperature.</p>

<p>Crape may be renovated by thoroughly brushing
all dust from the material, sprinkling with
alcohol, and rolling in newspaper, commencing
with the paper and crape together, so that the
paper may be between every portion of the
material. Allow it to remain so until dry.</p>

<p>A better plan for removing grease-spots than
by applying a hot iron is to rub in some spirit
of wine with the hand until the grease is brought
to powder, and there will be no trace of it.
Every schoolboy is not aware that ink-spots can
be removed from the leaves of books by using
a solution of oxalic acid in water; nor does every
housemaid know that ‘spots’ are easily cleaned
from varnished furniture by rubbing it with spirit
of camphor.</p>

<p>The elasticity of cane-chair bottoms can be
restored by washing the cane with soap and
water until it is well soaked, and then drying
thoroughly in the air, after which they will
become as tight and firm as new, if none of the
canes are broken.</p>

<p>Marks on tables caused by leaving hot jugs or
plates there will disappear under the soothing
influence of lamp-oil well rubbed in with a soft
cloth, finishing with a little spirit of wine or
eau-de-Cologne rubbed dry with another cloth.
When the white pianoforte keys become discoloured,
we should remove the front door, fall,
and slip of wood just over them; then lift up
each key separately from the front—do not take
them out—and rub the keys with a white cloth
slightly damped with cold water, and dry off
with a cloth slightly warm. Should the keys
be sticky, first damp the cloth with a little
spirit of wine or gin. Soap or washing-powder
must not be used. It is worth while keeping a
supply of ammonia in the household, in case
we wish to remove finger-marks from paint, or
require to cleanse brushes or greasy pans. A teaspoonful
in a basin of warm water will make
hair-brushes beautifully white; but care must
be taken not to let the backs of the brushes dip
below the surface. Rinse them with clean warm
water, and put in a sunny window to dry.</p>

<p>Egg-shells crushed into small bits and shaken
well in decanters three parts filled with cold
water, will not only clean them thoroughly, but
make the glass look like new. By rubbing with
a damp flannel dipped in the best whiting, the
brown discolorations may be taken off cups in
which custards have been baked. Again, are all
of us aware that emery powder will remove
ordinary stains from white ivory knife-handles,
or that the lustre of morocco leather is restored
by varnishing with white of egg?</p>

<p>Nothing, it is said, is better to clean silver
with than alcohol and ammonia, finishing with
a little whiting on a soft cloth. When putting
away the silver tea or coffee pot which is not in
use every day, lay a little stick across the top
under the cover. This will allow fresh air to get
in, and prevent the mustiness of the contents,
familiar to hotel and lodging-house sufferers.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
